          <h2>Hi! My name is Zach Skiles!</h2>
          <p>
            I am a sophomore at Purdue Univeristy studying Computer Science! This website
            is the first of many bigger projects I plan to work on throughout my college
            career. I coded it from scratch using the Bootstrap Framework so that I could
            gain a better understanding of Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and front-end
            web development in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            As far as academics go, these are the classes I am currently taking this
            semester (Fall 2019):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>CS 25000: Computer Architecture</li>
            <li>CS 25100: Data Structure and Algorithms</li>
            <li>MA 35100: Elementary Linear Algebra</li>
            <li>MUS 36200: Music Theory II</li>
            <li>DANC 10100: Modern Dance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            On top of my CS major, I am pursuing a Minor in Mathematics and a Certificate
            in Music Technology. These are purely based on my personal interests and
            passion for both mathematics and music. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As far as work experience goes, my first job was as a corn detasseler at
            Beck's Hybrids. I worked this job for 3 summers, from Summer 2015 - Summer 2017.
            It was hard work but I felt as though I could get through any job if I could get
            through that one. My last job was this past summer (2019), where I worked as 
            a tech intern for Greenfield-Central Community Schools. I helped solve general
            tech issues around the district and also helped with the roll-in/roll-out process
            of all the student/teacher devices, which included the collection, re-imaging, and
            re-distribution of said devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Purdue, I am involved in 2 clubs at the moment but plan to join at least 1 more as
            the semester progresses. The first is the Karate Club, which I joined in order to stay
            active and also to learn how to defend myself. Being a member entails learning the basic
            skills, sparring with other members, and working your way through the belt ranks. The other
            club I recently joined was b01lers, a security CTF (Capture-The-Flag) group here on campus.
            We learn basic hacking/security breaking techniques and compete in many competitions
            throughout the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I love what I do, it's not the only thing that I enjoy doing. In my free time, 
            I really love to read, play the piano, work on personal projects (like this website),
            or just hang out with friends. I listen to all kinds of different music, including 80's 
            rock, Indie, Lofi Hip-Hop, Classical, and much more.
